# To Do List Applicaiton:

## Description
Duration: 3 Day Sprint

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
I worked on this web application with the intent to help myself and others handle the issue of task management. With this application, people can use it as a tool to check off their to-do list and have their information stored within a database. Tasks can be added, deleted, and toggle between complete and in-progress.
